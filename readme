webider is an absurd attempt to aggregate all the domains that can be found on the internet.

- example proxy config

{
    "https": "socks5h://host:port",
    "http": "http://host:port"
}

- how to

```
# after cloning the project, creating a virtual environment and setting up the db uri in config.json
cd webider/src/
pip install -r requirements
python main.py
```

- missing dependency for SOCKS?

```
pip install requests[socks]
```
