-intro
webider is a project that I started to create a kind of
web crawler; it uses bs4 library to search webpages for
urls or <a> tags, sqlite to keep domains and sqlalchemy
to communicate with database, json format to keep
configs and requests module to get webpages content.

-quick start
at the beggining you have no domains available in your
database, so you have to search thru random domains;
then, when you have some domains it your database, you
can easily crawl them to get more!
to do this, open config file and change use_random_urls
value to false, now all you have to do is to run this
program again!

-requirements
requirements are listed in requirements file, create a
virtual env or install them on you system.
