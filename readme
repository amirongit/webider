-intro
webider is a project that I started to create a kind of
web crawler; it uses bs4 library to search webpages for
urls or <a> tags, sqlite to keep domains and sqlalchemy
to communicate with database, json format to keep
configs and requests module to get webpages content.

-quick start
at the beggining you have no domains available in your
database, so you have to search thru random domains;
then, when you have some domains it your database, you
can easily crawl them to get more!
to do this, open config file and change use_random_urls
value to false, now all you have to do is to run this
program again!

-requirements
requirements are listed in requirements file, create a
virtual env or install them on you system.

-Note
to run the program you most be in the src directory,
otherwise it won't work; also you can set a proxy in
config file to use when surfin/crawling.

-example proxy config

{
    "https": "socks5h://host:port",
    "http": "http://host:port"
}

*you can use either socks or http for both!

-searching thru random domains is so fukcing slow!

if you have domains to start and you don't want to
w8 for finding valid domains, you can put your own
domains in the database and change the value of
use_random_urls in config file, remember to set the
surfed field to 0 when inserting your domains.

-missing dependency for SOCKS error
just do pip install requests[socks]
